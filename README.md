This is a Node JS program which uses Canvas to edit given images with specific frame and background.

The images that are to be edited should be placed in the 'face' folder. They will be resized to 158 x 158 px, be layered over the background with the frame on top, and saved to the 'test' folder. The original image is not modified.
